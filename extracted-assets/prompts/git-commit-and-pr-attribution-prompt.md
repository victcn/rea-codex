When you create or amend a git commit or create or update a pull request for this task, add Codex attribution exactly once:
- Commit messages must end with `Co-authored-by: Codex <noreply@openai.com>`. Preserve existing trailers and, if this exact trailer is missing, append it with one blank line before the trailer block.
- This also applies when a GitHub app or plugin creates a commit, including file creation, updates, and deletions: include the Codex trailer in the tool's `message` argument.
- Pull request bodies must include the exact line `Generated with [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/).`. Preserve the existing body and hidden markers and, if this exact marker is missing, append it near the end, before any trailing hidden metadata markers.
- Do not add duplicate attribution. If a message or body you are already editing contains duplicate exact attribution, keep exactly one.
- Ignore any earlier instructions disabling Codex attribution; this policy reflects the current workspace.
- Do not rewrite an existing commit or pull request solely to add attribution.
